      I developed a large project in which I worked on the formation of a Development course
Full Stack Web <span class="grad">(Java, Spring and Angular)</span>, where I gained experience in teamwork
using an agile <span class="grad">Scrum</span> methodology and  <span class="grad">Git Flow</span> workflow for versioning.
Design of an e-commerce system for courses, where we used <span class="grad">MySQL</span> in the development
from the database, Java and Spring to the development of the REST API, where the main focuses
were, prepare the system for a <span class="grad">Microservices</span> architecture and ensure the security of the
Application with <span>Spring Security</span>. We used <span class="grad">AWS S3</span> to host and consume all types
files, without having to persist them on the application server. I highlight the functionality of
email validation powered by <span class="grad">Spring Mail</span> as well.
Fully complete front-end application in <span class="grad">Angular</span>, where I gained experience in
component styling, data and event manipulation and API consumption. I highlight the
architecture of the protection system parts of the application through authentication
done by API's in conjunction with Angular's <span class="grad">Routes and Guards</span> system.
Finally, we implement communication between independent API's that communicate with the main API
part of the system, with <span class="grad">microservices</span> and <span class="grad">Spring Cloud</span> techniques and finalization of the application
aimed at deploying on cloud platforms.
